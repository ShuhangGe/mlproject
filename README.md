# mlproject
Because of the dataset file is large and we are unable to upload to Gradescope, so we extracted all the data and sent it to Ashutosh, just unzip the data and put them to the folder. 

To run the code locally, download the source code zip file and follow the steps below:
1. ‘cd’ to the unzipped project folder.
2. Run the command ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’ to get all the dependencies required for this project.
3. Run the command ‘python train.py’ to start the project. 
4. Modify config.py to change the parameters. 

* The instructions are only verified on Windows, the dataset has been preprocessed and sent to TA Ashutosh. Contact the group members if run into any issues.
